Assignments done during the ECON3096: Causal Inference: Capturing Cause-and-Effect Relationships with Data course.

## About the course:

- Covering a variety of research designs, statistical concept and data analytic methods for causal inference, including counterfactual, randomised experiments, treatment effects, matching, regression, difference-in-differences, panel data estimation etc.
- Analysing the strengths and weaknesses of these methods, as well as introduce the application of the pertinent methods using the programming language of R. The emphasis will be on understanding what various methods do (e.g. the intuition behind each method), rather than on the study of the mechanical and mathematical features of estimators. 
- Real life examples are drawn from various fields in social science, including economics, public policy, and political science to help strengthening our understanding of these methods.
