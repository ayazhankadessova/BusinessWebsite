(1) Suppose we are now interested to find out whether union protection is useful to increase one's wage, design several multivarate regression with control variables and a TWFE regression to test it. Report the results in a table and give your own interpretation. (Hints: Consider which variables might be correlated with joining a union and wage and add them as control varialbes)

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

read_csv("wage.csv")  -> wage

# simple bivariate regression
lm(wage ~ union, data=wage) -> wage01
summary(wage01)

# add more control variables 
wage$exper2 <- (wage$exper)^2
lm(wage ~ union + exper + exper2 + hlth + black + hisp + school + mar , data=wage) -> wage02
summary(wage02)

# add regional fixed effects
lm(wage ~ union + exper + exper2 + hlth + black + hisp + school + mar + rur + s + nc + ne, data=wage) -> wage03

summary(wage06)

# report the results from all six regressions
tab_model(wage01, wage02, wage03, wage04, wage05, wage06, 
          show.ci = F, 
          show.se = T, 
          collapse.se = T, 
          p.style = "stars", 
          show.intercept = F,
          strings = NULL,
          terms = c("mar", "exper", "exper2", "hlth", "black", "hisp", "school", "union"),
          pred.labels = c("Union",
                          "Experience",
                          "Experience^2",
                          "Health Disability (=1)",
                          "Black",
                          "Hispanic",
                          "Years of School",
                          "Married (=1)"),
          dv.labels = c("", "Hourly", "Wage", "(Logged)", "", ""),
          string.pred = "Coeffcient")

# We run multiple regressions by regressing wage (`wage`) on the regressor of interest wage set by collective bargaining (`union`), and add the control variables, such as Experience, Health Disability, race, etc. We also use TWFE regression. 

# To see if union protection is useful in increasing one's wage, let's pay attention to the first row, changes in the the coefficients of wage set by collective bargaining ($\beta$) after adding the control variables. We add other variables as control variables to solve the selection bias problem or omitted bias problem. 

# When we control for Experience, Health Disability, Black, Hispanic, Years of School, Married, the magnitute is positive and the coefficient is about the same (~0.18). All of the coefficients are statistically significant from zero because p-value is less that 0.1% significance level. 

# In the Column 1, it is a positive number and in the following columns, it also is a positive number with the same significance level. It means that before we control for anything and just look at relationship between wage and wage set through bargains and after, in both ways, higher wage set through bargaining -> higher wage. 

# It means that bivariate regression in Column 1 is not biased by omitted variable bias. After we control for omitted variables to deal with this bias, we show a that the initial relationship was a true relationship, which is positive. higher wage set through bargaining -> higher wage.

# We have also added TWFE to eliminate effects of year and individual identifier. Individual identifier is an obvious omitted variable, because it is time invariant individual characteristic that can affect one's income and his or her wage gotten by bargaining. Moreover, if there was some common shock to all at a particular year, e.g. an economic recession may both reduce one’s income and also delay one’s wage set by bargaining, then we absorb the effect of the year.

# Talking about the null hypothesis of the wage set by unions, it was not rejected in any of the multivariate regressions.

(2) Do the results from Q1 change if you use classical SEs, robust SEs, or clustered SEs at individual level? Please compare and provide your interpretations. 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}


# Oop! Forgot to cluster the standard errors 
# re-run the regressions using clustered standard errors at individual level

(3) Plot the relationship between union and wage controlling for the TWFE. (Hints: Use anatomy regression to get residuals from TWFE)

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## anatomy regression 

# use TWFE
lm(wage ~ union + exper + exper2 + hlth + black + hisp + school + mar + rur + s + nc + ne + ag + min + con + trad + tra + fin + bus + per + ent + man + pro + pub + occ1 + occ2 + occ3 + occ4 + occ5 + occ6 + occ7 + occ8 + occ9 + factor(nr) + factor(year), data=wage) -> poc_iv_rl
resid(poc_iv_rl)-> union.res 

cbind(wage, union.res) -> wage
lm(wage ~ union.res, data=wage) -> anatomy_rl
summary(anatomy_rl)

### graph p.23
wage %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=wage, y=union)) +
  geom_point(color="red", alpha=0.2)+
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=F, color="red") +
  geom_point(aes(x=union.res+mean(union), y=wage), color="blue", alpha=0.4) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x=union.res+mean(union), y=wage), method="lm", se=F, color="blue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x="Union wage",
       y="Wage")

```

(4) From the following panel view plot, we can see that some individuals in our samples had never joined union and some were always union member throughout the observation period. What if we remove these two groups of individual (whose union status is always 0 or 1) and re-run the TWFE, does it provides us a different estimations? Check this out by running some additional regressions. 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(panelView)
panelview(wage ~ union,
          data = wage, index = c("nr","year"),
          xlab = "Year", ylab = "Individual", by.timing = TRUE)

# lm(wage ~ union + exper + exper2 + hlth + black + hisp + school + mar + rur + s + nc + ne + ag + min + con + trad + tra + fin + bus + per + ent + man + pro + pub + occ1 + occ2 + occ3 + occ4 + occ5 + occ6 + occ7 + occ8 + occ9 + factor(nr) + factor(year), data=wage) -> wage06
# summary(wage06)

```

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

wage[wage$union == 1, ] 
wage[wage$union == 0, ] 


panelview(wage ~ union + exper + exper2 + hlth + black + hisp + school + mar + rur + s + nc + ne + ag + min + con + trad + tra + fin + bus + per + ent + man + pro + pub + occ1 + occ2 + occ3 + occ4 + occ5 + occ6 + occ7 + occ8 + occ9 + factor(nr) + factor(year), data = wage, index = c("nr","year"), 
          xlab = "Year", ylab = "Individual", by.timing = TRUE)

```

(5) Does the effect of union protection on wage change over time? Design a regression to test it. 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

read_csv("wage.csv")  -> wage

fit <- lm(wage ~ union + factor(year), data=wage)
summary(fit)

# Yes, it rises over time. In 1981, the effect was  0.11973 and in 1987, it was 0.47098. All with significance levels of 0.1%.

# # plot a regression line
# abline(fit,col='red')

# abline(lm(wage ~ union + factor(year), data=wage), col = "blue")

```

(6) Among the 12 industries, which one union had the greatest power in terms of raising wage for its participants? Design a regression to answer this question. (Hints: Use interaction terms)
