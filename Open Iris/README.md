## Time do to an end-to-end project in data science. which means:

1. Loading the dataset.
2. Summarizing the dataset.
3. Visualizing the dataset.
4. Evaluating some algorithms.
5. Making some predictions.

Must-see example of data science is the iris dataset. In this project, I tried to predict which class of iris plant a plant belongs to based on its characteristics.
