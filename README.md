# Protfolio-Projects

Projects that were accomplised during the QWANT DS Track.

1. **Convex Optimization**

In this project, I learned performance measure through Gradient Descent Methods, answering questions such as how a learning rate influences the efficiency of the algorithm, and used Simplex Algorithm to find optimal values.

2. **DS Babel**

Using cursor and iteratively reading an sql file, then writing it into a csv; converting a csv to sql through queries and Python's sqlite3 module.

3. **FAFA** 

>1.	Scraped the data from the https://fa-fa.kz/search_load/gruzy-almaty/ with Beautiful Soup in fafa_Almaty.py and wrote it in fafa_Almaty.csv
>2.	Cleaned Data in fafa_Almaty.csv
>3.	In fafa_Almaty.ipynb: Introduced Data,
>4.	Did an Exploratory Data Analysis, 
>5.	Answered 3 Business Questions through calculations and visualizations with seaborn and matplotlib.pyplot.
>6.	Presented Suggestions on a profitable business model

I summarized Projects steps in the BlogPost: https://fafkz-scraping.blogspot.com/2021/09/scraping-fafakz-for-almaty-delivery.html .

4. **Github Scraper**

Using Python's requests and beautifulsoup4 modules, returning a CSV of the TOP 25 trending repositories from Github's page (https://github.com/trending). Following information is included: Developer, Repository Name, Number of Stars.

5. **Open Iris**

Loading the dataset with pandas; Summarizing the dataset; Visualizing the dataset with seaborn; Evaluating algorithms with sklearn's DecisionTreeClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, LogisticRegression, SVC; Making predictions about which class of iris plant does a plant belongs to based on its characteristics through training the data with sklearn's train_test_data, and showing the accuracy score.

6. **NBA Game Analysis**

Immersing in the NBA game dataset, parsing a csv, which describes both teams' players' game activities to
create a table, separately for home and away team, with statistics (FG, FGA, FG%, 3P, 3PA, FT) of all players by finding keywords with Python's Regex Module. Additional calculations were done for some stats.
